Hello!

My name is Will and I'm interested in programming, wakeskating, and a handful of other things I'm progressively less good at.

This is me wiring up a personal website, and this blog is starting primarily so I've got a little bit of content to *fatten* it up.

At the same time it gives me a chance to improve both my technical and not-so-technical writing skills, something I haven't truly done since leaving college.

You can find me on GitHub as [Zulu-Inuoe](https://github.com/Zulu-Inuoe).
