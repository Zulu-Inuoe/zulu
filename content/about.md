## Current

[:(far fa-file): Resume][resume]

I'm based out of Orlando, Florida, USA, and am currently working as a freelance developer learning more web-focused technologies.

My work history includes:

* Military Small-Arms Simulations with C, C++, and C#
* Experience with CryEngine and Unity
* Windows Desktop UI development
* LAN Networking with [TCP/UDP][networking] and [DDS][dds]

## Bio

I've been exposed to computers since I was about 10, but primarily for video games, chat rooms, that sort of thing.

I didn't pick up programming until I on-a-whim decided that 'computer science' sounded kind of interesting when registering in college. Prior to that the closest I'd come to programming anything was writing a single trivially simple HTML site for a highschool class.

I did well enough in my classes, made a couple of games in Java, braindead intro to C programs, the usual.

I'd even began delving into [TCP/IP][networking], having a dream to make an online [D&D][dnd] + [Legend of Zelda][loz] game with one player as the DM that I still want to make to this day.

But I didn't really 'get' programming until later, when in third year of college at [UCF][ucf] I had a wonderful combination of:
1. A System's Programming class teaching us about lexers, parsers, bytecode compilers and interpreters
2. An intro to AI class where the professor mostly spent their time teaching us about [Common Lisp][cl]

That's the year I could finally say "I know how to program in C" and mean it. I'd also spent winter break on a family RV roadtrip where I downloaded the [Common Lisp Hyperspec][clhs] and worked out a buggy, non-functional program to play Dominoes in [CL][cl].

I even made a handful of [CL][cl] tutorials, which you should absolutely not watch but are available on [YouTube][cl-tutorials].
I am actually interested in revisiting those if/when time allows for it.
